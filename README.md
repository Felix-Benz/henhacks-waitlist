**Waitlist for Medical Offices, Powered by Gemini**
_An intelligent waitlist system that prioritizes patients based on symptom severity using AI._ 

It uses a severity scale from 1-100 to ensure that high-priority cases get the medical attention they need.
Patients can view their spot on the waitlist, and the offices can view the list with the patients' information and take them off the waitlist once they are treated.

Technologies:
- **Backend**: Node.js & express
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Symptom Analytics**: Google's Gemini AI
- **Frontend**: Javascript, HTML, CSS
